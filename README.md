**Segue** is a system-agnostic, cinematic module for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/) V13+ that enables smooth, customizable fade-to-black scene transitions to enhance immersion for your GM storytelling and reduce perceived loading times between scene activations for connected players. Use it to introduce new locations, chapter changes, dramatic combat scenes or anything else!

Several Google Fonts included. See [assets/fonts](assets/fonts/) for licensing and details.

## Usage

1. Right-click on a Scene in the sidebar or navigation --> **Configure**
2. Click on the **"Segue"** tab
3. Enable the transition for the scene and customize the settings
4. Activate the scene via the Segue option in the right-click context menu (in either the Scene Directory or Navigation)  

---

## Global Settings

Found in **Game Settings > Configure Settings > Segue**:
- **Display Segue over UI**: If enabled, the overlay will cover the entire Foundry canvas. Disable to allow the UI (chat, journals, characters sheets, etc) to remain visible during transitions.
- **Display Segue under UI for GM only**: As suggested, this will display the Segue below the UI for the GM, leaving all UI elements visible (e.g., journals, character sheets, etc). Players will still see the full canvas overlay if the above option is enabled.
